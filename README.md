# Goal Tracker

[Live Demo](https://goaltrack444.herokuapp.com/)

## Overview
This project is a simple goal tracking application. Users can register and login to create and delete goals. The application used JWT and bcrypt for authentication and hashing passwords. This is my first project that incorporates authentication and it was a big learning experience. This project was a stepping stone to gain experience with full-stack projects that incorporate authentication, and contains a lot of functionality that I hope to incorporate into future projects. 

## Tech Stack
- MongoDB/Mongoose
- Express
- React (with React-Router)
- Redux toolkit
- Node
- JWT
- BcryptJS

Note: This project was built following a tutorial by Brad Traversy. All the code is my own, aside from CSS provided by the tutorial, which was copy/pasted in.
